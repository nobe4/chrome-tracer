# Google-tracer

Whenever I open Google Chrome, I open the network tab, to see every request. Now, I can leave the dev tools closed and see the requests on-page.

# Installation

1. Clone/copy the repo locally
2. Open chrome extensions page ( `chrome://extensions/` )
3. Activate developer's mode
4. `Load unpacked extension`

# What ?

This is a small Google Chrome extension that logs every request made from a tab (each tab has its own set of requests).

Yes, this extension will read every request you make, but I do nothing more with it than displaying a fancy list of numbers.

# Actions

With the `▼`/`▲` arrow you can hide and show the request list.

With the `⥥`/`⥮` you can toggle the auto-scroll.

When you click on a request id, the request url appears on the right of the request list.
